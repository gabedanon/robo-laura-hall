## About

This code is the basis of Robo Laura Hall, the robotic producter on the [Trends with Benefits](http://twb.cool) podcast. She is very sassy and unprofessional, and she makes use of these native browser features:

* [SpeechSynthesis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis)
* [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) and [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/LocalStorage) via [localForage](https://github.com/localForage/localForage)

As such, probably only works in Chrome. Due to her general volatility, we have not dared to try another browser.

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
